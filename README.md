## Description
   The motivation behind the product is that I want to create a blog post that I could interact with, with other users who are willing to sign up. Its free and you can make a post while allowing others the ability to comment on that post you made. It solves the problem of being less connected and allows me to be available and more ocnnected to others from around the world. I learned that building a full stack application from nothing is incredibly time consuming and I learned that I need to respect that process in order to have completion.
